    <h2>Ale</h2>
    <p>Hello all, my name is Alejandra! Although I'm pursuing some education in web development and computer programming, I'm planning to eventually earn a degree in Biology and hopefully work in a zoo.</p>

    <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for 10 years, and one of my favorite scriptures is Alma 36:17-21.</p>

    <p>Some of my favorite things to do include creating digital art, listening to music, watching Bollywood movies, and hanging out with my chickens! I also love the music, the tv shows, and the fashion from the 60s and 70s!</p>
